## Upgrade instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating your wrapper:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@`

See the [Gradle 7.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_7.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@. 

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).

<!-- Do not add breaking changes or deprecations here! Add them to the upgrade guide instead. -->

### FILL-IN-KEY-AREA improvements

<<<FILL IN CONTEXT FOR KEY AREA>>>
Example:
> The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of
> the configuration phase. Using the configuration cache, Gradle can skip the configuration phase entirely when
> nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### FILL-IN-FEATURE
> HIGHLIGHT the usecase or existing problem the feature solves
> EXPLAIN how the new release addresses that problem or use case
> PROVIDE a screenshot or snippet illustrating the new feature, if applicable
> LINK to the full documentation for more details

### Improvements for IDE integrators

#### Tooling API progress events expose difference between test assertion failures and test framework failures

Gradle 7.6 introduces new failure types for the `Failure` interface returned by [FailureResult.getFailures()](javadoc/org/gradle/tooling/events/FailureResult.html#getFailures--): TestAssertionFailure and TestFrameworkFailure. 
IDEs can now easily distinguish between different failures using standard progress event listeners. 
Moreover, `TestAssertionFailure` exposes the expected and actual values if the used test framework supply such information.

#### Task execution with TestLauncher

The [TestLauncher](javadoc/org/gradle/tooling/TestLauncher.html) interface now allows Tooling API clients to execute any tasks along with the selected tasks.

```
ProjectConnection connection = ...
connection.newTestLauncher()
          .withTaskAndTestClasses("integTest", ["org.MyTest"])
          .forTasks("startDB")
          .run()
```

Note, that the task execution only works if the target Gradle version is >=7.6.

#### Fine-grained test selection with TestLauncher

The [TestLauncher](javadoc/org/gradle/tooling/TestLauncher.html) interface now allows Tooling API clients to select test classes, methods, packages and patterns with a new API.

```
TestLauncher testLauncher = projectConnection.newTestLauncher();
testLauncher.withTestsFor(spec -> {
    spec.forTaskPath(":test")
        .includePackage("org.pkg")
        .includeClass("com.TestClass")
        .includeMethod("com.TestClass")
        .includePattern("io.*")
}).run();
```

Note, that the new test selection interface only works if the target Gradle version is >=7.6.

### Improved Maven Conversion

The `init` task now adds compile-time Maven dependencies to Gradle's `api` configuration when converting a Maven project. This sharply reduces the number of compilation errors resulting from the automatic conversion utility. See the [Build Init Plugin](userguide/build_init_plugin.html#sec:pom_maven_conversion) for more information.

### Configuration cache improvements

The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build time by caching the result of the configuration phase and reusing this for subsequent builds.

#### New compatible tasks

The `dependencies`, `buildEnvironment`, `projects` and `properties` tasks are now compatible with the configuration cache.
